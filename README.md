## Style guidelines for code

### Commits
- Always write a message when commiting and make it short but meaningful:
```
  git commit -m 'updated README.md'
```
- Commit when you have added a substantial ammount of code (an entire journey, a section, corrected a bug, etc.)


### SCSS
- All documentation will be written in English, except in cases when Spanish is desirable because of practicity ([example](https://github.com/lualparedes/guia-web/blob/master/README.md#todo-general)).
